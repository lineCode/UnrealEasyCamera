# EasyCamera: A Simplified Camera System for You to Create Plentiful Gameplay Camera Movements and Effects

***EasyCamera*** is a simplified, extensible and designer-friendly camera system for Unreal Engine. It enhances the built-in spring arm and camera components in native Unreal editor across a wide variety of common gameplay camera behaviours such as keeping a target at a fixed screen position, moving on rail, and resolving occulusion in complex occasions, enabling you to easily create plentiful smooth camera movements and effects within only few minutes.

Currently ***EasyCamera*** only supports Unreal Engine version 5.1. So before using this plugin, please upgrade your project to Unreal Engine 5.1. We are also working on migrating ***EasyCamera*** to Unreal Engine 5.0, but this may take some time.

For manuals of ***EasyCamera***, please refer to the [Manuals Of EasyCamera](Docs/ManualsOfEasyCamera.md) page. This page will guide you through the basic uses and advanced features of **EasyCamera**, and it will also give you some examples showcasing what it can do and how to basically set up your own cameras.

You can also go to the [Gitbook page](https://sulleyyys-organization.gitbook.io/manuals-of-easycamera/) for a better reading experience.
